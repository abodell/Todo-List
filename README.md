# Todo-List
Todo List Application where you can create different tasks and set a due date for them as well as a priority for the task.  The different priorities are color coded based on the urgency of the task.  The task card will show the title, the description, and the due date for the task and will also include a remove button.  You can create as many lists as you'd like in order to keep up with tasks that fall into different categories.
